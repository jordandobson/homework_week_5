_Week Four Assignment_

There were more layers to keep track of than I expected. I had the most trouble with setting up the tableView and figuring out how to force a save on close.

I found the Week5 video on TableView setup the best resource and the NSWindow week4 video.

I added a lot more features than were needed because there were odd states when first loaded or when deleting off a menu and since those are important to me I tended to try to resolve them. I especially focused on the non selected state and how the UI should respond and also selecting the text when you add a new item so you can type right away. It was nice to adjust my loops to use a simpler approach. I definitely feel the window controller is getting heavy and starting to handle more than it needs. Handling some things at a view level will be much nicer.
