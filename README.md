Drawing Board

_Week Five Assignment_

I feel like this was one of the easier ones. I typically have a bit of a hard time with the strucutre of the app but this one was simpler and the video for view switching really helped me. I did struggle a bit to get the refresh button work but once I realized how to call into it that helped me push though.

The view switching video and apples drawing documentation were the most helpful. Also just reviewing the project in class helped too. I also used a reference for how to create the golden ratio but it was just formulas I had to translate to code. I did an okay job with it. I was just happy to get it working.

I really wanted to add some transitions in between views but I couldn't find the class video that included that. I was hoping to get that in there. Maybe I will another time if I come across it again. I really enjoyed this project and felt like it was the first thing that was familiar to me. I've done a lot of drawing with code so it was nice to see some similarities between defining SVG and Canvas in HTML5.

I also now realize after reading through the apple docs again that I could have drawn that rectangle in the shapes section much easier.
